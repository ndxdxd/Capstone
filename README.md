# Project: Exploring Watermark Attacks
By Anushka Purohit and Andy Truong

This project highlights different watermark attacks such as destructive and regenerative attacks. 

This project explores the question: What are the different types of watermarking removal attacks and what is the most effective at removing and maintaining image quality? 

## Running the project

To install the dependencies, run the following command from the root directory of the project: pip install -r requirements.txt

Use the demo.ipynb file in the notebook folder to look at the destructive attacks and its effect on images. We also tried our own attack combined a destructive and constructive attack. Also, see how the stable diffusion regeneration attack works on different types of watermarks and its evaluations.
